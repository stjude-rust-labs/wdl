# Note that we explicitly have to set this diagnostic level, even though warning is the default. The
# current deserialization logic for the analyzer config is very basic, and so the absence of a field
# is interpreted as `None` and therefore disabling the warning in question. If we ever make
# serialized configs a user-facing feature, we should improve this experience.
