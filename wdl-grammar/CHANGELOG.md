### Fixed

  that it can disambiguate between the `sep` option and a `sep` function
  call ([#44](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/44)).

### Added

* Adds support for workflow statements in the experimental parser
  ([#49](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/49)).
* Adds support for runtime sections in the experimental parser
  ([#48](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/48)).
* Adds support for command sections in the experimental parser
  ([#47](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/47)).
* Adds support for input and output sections in the experimental
  parser ([#46](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/46)).
* Adds support for import statements to the experimental parser ([#43](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/43)).

  parser ([#42](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/42)).
* Adds support for parsing `meta` and `parameter_meta` sections in tasks
  and workflows in the experimental parser ([#39](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/39)).

  requires the `experimental` feature to be activated ([#38](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/38)).
* Adds a new experimental `SyntaxTree` representation; requires the 
  `experimental` feature to be activated ([#36](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/36)).
* Adds an `experimental` module containing the start of a new
  infallible WDL parser implementation based on `logos` and `rowan` ([#30](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/30)).
* Adds the `missing_runtime_block` rule for tasks (#10, contributed by
  @markjschreiber).

* Updates formatting to `version = "Two"` (f63c188).
* Moves `tokio` to the workspace dependencies (66da811).

## 0.1.0 â€” 11-22-2023

### Added

* Adds initial version of parsing WDL 1.x grammar.
* Adds `wdl-grammar` tool, a tool that is useful in creating and exhausitvely
  testing the `wdl-grammar` crate.
    * The following subcommands are included in the initial release:
        * `wdl-grammar create-test`: scaffolds otherwise arduous Rust tests that
        ensure a provided input and grammar rule are generated into the correct
        Pest parse tree.
        * `wdl-grammar gauntlet`: an exhaustive testing framework for ensuring
        `wdl-grammar` can parse a wide variety of grammars in the community.
        * `wdl-grammar parse`: prints the Pest parse tree for a given input and
        grammar rule or outputs errors regarding why the input could not be
        parsed.
    * This command line tool is available behind the `binaries` feature flag and
      is not intended to be used by a general audience. It is only intended for
      developers of the `wdl-grammar` crate.
