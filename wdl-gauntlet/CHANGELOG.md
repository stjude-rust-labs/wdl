## 0.2.0 - 05-31-2024

### Changed

* Core goal of crate is split in two:
  * **The goal of** (base) **`wdl-gauntlet` is to ensure the parsing of syntactically valid WDLs never regresses.**
  * **The goal of `wdl-gauntlet --arena` is to test lint rules against WDL "in the wild".**
* `LintWarnings` are ignored (when there is no `--arena` flag)
* uses `libgit2` (via the `git2` crate) instead of the GitHub REST API (via `octocrab` and `reqwest` crates)
* no more persistent cache (Now uses `temp-dir`)

### Added

* The `--arena` flag and `Arena.toml` for lint rule testing
* more test repos!
* test repos are tracked at specific commits

## 0.1.0 â€” 12-17-2023

### Added
