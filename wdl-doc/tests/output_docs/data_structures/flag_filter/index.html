<h1>flag_filter</h1><p>WDL Version: 1.1</p><h1>FlagFilter</h1>
<p>A struct to represent the filtering flags used in various <code>samtools</code> commands.
The order of precedence is <code>include_if_all</code>, <code>exclude_if_any</code>, <code>include_if_any</code>,
and <code>exclude_if_all</code>.
These four fields correspond to the samtools flags
<code>-f</code>, <code>-F</code>, <code>--rf</code>, and <code>-G</code> respectively.
The values of these fields are strings that represent a 12bit bitwise flag.
These strings must evaluate to an integer less than 4096 (2^12).
They can be in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal format.
Please see the <code>meta.help</code> of <code>validate_string_is_12bit_oct_dec_or_hex</code>
for more information on the valid formats.</p>
<p>The <code>validate_flag_filter</code> workflow can be used to validate a <code>FlagFilter</code> struct.
<strong>WARNING</strong> The <code>validate_flag_filter</code> workflow will only check that all the fields
can be parsed as integers less than 4096. It will not check if the flags are
sensible input to <code>samtools fastq</code>.
<code>samtools fastq</code> also employs very little error checking on the flags.
So it is possible to pass in flags that produce nonsensical output.
For example, it is possible to pass in flags that produce no output.
<strong>Please exhibit caution while modifying any default values of a <code>FlagFilter</code>.</strong></p>
<p>We suggest using the Broad Institute's SAM flag explainer to construct the flags.

<h2>Example input JSON</h2>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
   "flags": {
       "include_if_all": "0x3",
       "exclude_if_any": "0xF04",
       "include_if_any": "0x0",
       "exclude_if_all": "0x0"
   }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The above example JSON represents a <code>FlagFilter</code> struct
being passed to parameter named <code>flags</code>.
The <code>include_if_all</code> field is set to <code>0x3</code> which is <code>3</code> in decimal.
The <code>exclude_if_any</code> field is set to <code>0xF04</code> which is <code>3844</code> in decimal.
The <code>include_if_any</code> field is set to <code>0x0</code> which is <code>0</code> in decimal.
The <code>exclude_if_all</code> field is set to <code>0x0</code> which is <code>0</code> in decimal.</p>
<p><code>3</code> in decimal can be represented as <code>000000000011</code> in 12bit binary.
This number means that to be included a read must have the 1st and 2nd bits set.
Those bits correspond to the <code>read paired</code> and <code>read mapped in proper pair</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>3844</code> in decimal can be represented as <code>111100000100</code> in 12bit binary.
This number means that to be excluded a read must have <strong>any</strong> of the
3rd, 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th bits set.
We won't go through what all those bits mean here, but you can find
the meanings of the bits in the
<a href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html">SAM flag explainer</a>.
In short, those are all flags corresponding to the quality of the read
and them being <code>true</code> may indicate that the read is of low quality and
should be excluded.</p>
